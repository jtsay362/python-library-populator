Creates a Document Collection file for the Python standard library

This project serves an example of how to create a Document Collection in Solve fora All. 
It is the source of the Python Library Documentation Document Collection.

Usage:
  ruby main.rb <DOC_DIR> <OUTPUT_FILE>
  
where <DOC_DIR> is the path to the uncompressed Python documentation in HTML format, like ~/docs/python-3.4.1-docs-html.

OUTPUT_FILE will be a .json file you can upload to a Document Collection in solveforall.com

Have fun!
